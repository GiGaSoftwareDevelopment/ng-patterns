itself, the  element does not render anything. The popover is attached to and opened\nvia application of the uiPopoverTriggerFor directive:\n\n\nToggling the popover programmatically\nThe popover exposes an API to open/close programmatically. Please note that in this case, an\nuiPopoverTriggerFor directive is still necessary to attach the popover to a trigger element in the DOM.\nclass MyComponent {\n  @ViewChild(UiPopoverTrigger) trigger: UiPopoverTrigger;\n\n  someMethod() {\n    this.trigger.openMenu();\n  }\n}Icons\nMenus support displaying mat-icon elements before the popover item text.\n\n\nCustomizing popover position\nBy default, the popover will display below (y-axis), after (x-axis), without overlapping\nits trigger. The position can be changed using the xPosition (before | after) and yPosition\n(above | below) attributes. The popover can be forced to overlap the trigger using the\noverlapTrigger attribute.\n\n\nNested popover\nMaterial supports the ability for an uiux-popover-item to open a sub-popover. To do so, you have to define\nyour root popover and sub-popovers, in addition to setting the [uiPopoverTriggerFor] on the uiux-popover-item\nthat should trigger the sub-popover:\n\n\nLazy rendering\nBy default, the popover content will be initialized even when the panel is closed. To defer\ninitialization until the popover is open, the content can be provided as an ng-template\nwith the uiPopoverContent attribute:\n\n  \n    Settings\n    Help\n  \n\n\n\n  more_vert\nPassing in data to a popover\nWhen using lazy rendering, additional context data can be passed to the popover panel via\nthe uiPopoverTriggerData input. This allows for a single popover instance to be rendered\nwith a different set of data, depending on the trigger that opened it:\n\n  \n    Settings\n    Log off {{name}}\n  \n\n\n\n  more_vert\n\n\n\n  more_vert\nKeyboard interaction\n\n\n\nKeyboard shortcut\nAction\n\n\n\n\nDown Arrow\nFocus the next popover item.\n\n\nUp Arrow\nFocus the previous popover item.\n\n\nLeft Arrow\nClose the current popover if it is a sub-popover.\n\n\nRight Arrow\nOpens the current popover item's sub-popover.\n\n\nEnter\nActivate the focused popover item.\n\n\nEscape\nClose all open popovers.\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nAngular Material's popover component consists of two connected parts: the trigger and the pop-up popover.\nThe popover trigger is a standard button element augmented with aria-haspopup, aria-expanded, and\naria-controls to create the relationship to the pop-up panel.\nThe pop-up popover implements the role=\"popover\" pattern, handling keyboard interaction and focus\nmanagement. Upon opening, the trigger will focus the first focusable popover item. Upon close, the popover\nwill return focus to its trigger. Avoid creating a popover in which all items are disabled, instead\nhiding or disabling the popover trigger.\nAngular Material does not support the popoveritemcheckbox or popoveritemradio roles.\nAlways provide an accessible label via aria-label or aria-labelledby for any popover\ntriggers or popover items without descriptive text content.\n\n    \n\n    \n        import {FocusKeyManager, FocusOrigin} from '@angular/cdk/a11y';\nimport {Direction} from '@angular/cdk/bidi';\nimport {BooleanInput, coerceBooleanProperty} from '@angular/cdk/coercion';\nimport {\n  ESCAPE,\n  LEFT_ARROW,\n  RIGHT_ARROW,\n  DOWN_ARROW,\n  UP_ARROW,\n  hasModifierKey\n} from '@angular/cdk/keycodes';\nimport {\n  AfterContentInit,\n  ChangeDetectionStrategy,\n  Component,\n  ContentChild,\n  ContentChildren,\n  Directive,\n  ElementRef,\n  EventEmitter,\n  Inject,\n  InjectionToken,\n  Input,\n  NgZone,\n  OnDestroy,\n  Output,\n  TemplateRef,\n  QueryList,\n  ViewChild,\n  ViewEncapsulation,\n  OnInit\n} from '@angular/core';\nimport {merge, Observable, Subject, Subscription} from 'rxjs';\nimport {startWith, switchMap, take} from 'rxjs/operators';\nimport {uiPopoverAnimations} from './popover-animations';\nimport {UI_POPOVER_CONTENT, UiPopoverContent} from './popover-content';\nimport {MenuPositionX, MenuPositionY} from './popover-positions';\nimport {\n  throwUiPopoverInvalidPositionX,\n  throwUiPopoverInvalidPositionY\n} from './popover-errors';\nimport {UiPopoverItem} from './popover-item';\nimport {UI_POPOVER_PANEL, UiPopoverPanel} from './popover-panel';\nimport {AnimationEvent} from '@angular/animations';\n\n/** Default `uiux-popover` options that can be overridden. */\nexport interface UiPopoverDefaultOptions {\n  /** The x-axis position of the popover. */\n  xPosition: MenuPositionX;\n\n  /** The y-axis position of the popover. */\n  yPosition: MenuPositionY;\n\n  /** Whether the popover should overlap the popover trigger. */\n  overlapTrigger: boolean;\n\n  /** Class to be applied to the popover's backdrop. */\n  backdropClass: string;\n\n  /** Class or list of classes to be applied to the popover's overlay panel. */\n  overlayPanelClass?: string | string[];\n\n  /** Whether the popover has a backdrop. */\n  hasBackdrop?: boolean;\n}\n\n/** Injection token to be used to override the default options for `uiux-popover`. */\nexport const UI_POPOVER_DEFAULT_OPTIONS =\n  new InjectionToken('uiux-popover-default-options', {\n    providedIn: 'root',\n    factory: UI_POPOVER_DEFAULT_OPTIONS_FACTORY\n  });\n\n/** @docs-private */\nexport function UI_POPOVER_DEFAULT_OPTIONS_FACTORY(): UiPopoverDefaultOptions {\n  return {\n    overlapTrigger: false,\n    xPosition: 'after',\n    yPosition: 'below',\n    backdropClass: 'cdk-overlay-transparent-backdrop'\n  };\n}\n\nlet popoverPanelUid = 0;\n\n/** Reason why the popover was closed. */\nexport type MenuCloseReason = void | 'click' | 'keydown' | 'tab';\n\n/** Base class with all of the `UiPopover` functionality. */\n@Directive()\nexport class _UiPopoverBase\n  implements AfterContentInit, UiPopoverPanel, OnInit, OnDestroy\n{\n  private _keyManager!: FocusKeyManager;\n  private _xPosition: MenuPositionX = this._defaultOptions.xPosition;\n  private _yPosition: MenuPositionY = this._defaultOptions.yPosition;\n  private _previousElevation!: string;\n  protected _elevationPrefix!: string;\n  protected _baseElevation!: number;\n\n  /** All items inside the popover.

System\nQuick Start & Documentation\nNx Documentation\nMental model is a good starting point for those who like to understand things theoretically first.\nInteractive Tutorial\nAdding capabilities to your workspace\nNx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.\nThese capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.\nBelow are our core plugins:\n\nAngular\nng add @nrwl/angular\n\n\nReact\nng add @nrwl/react\n\n\nWeb (no framework frontends)\nng add @nrwl/web\n\n\nNest\nng add @nrwl/nest\n\n\nExpress\nng add @nrwl/express\n\n\nNode\nng add @nrwl/node\n\n\n\nThere are also many community plugins you could add.\nGenerate an application\nRun ng g @nrwl/angular:app my-app to generate an application.\n\nYou can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.\n\nWhen using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.\nGenerate a library\nRun ng g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib to generate a library.\n\nYou can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.\n\nLibraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from @ng-patterns/mylib.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve my-app for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng g component my-component --project=my-app to generate a new component.\nBuild\nRun ng build my-app to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test my-app to execute the unit tests via Jest.\nRun nx affected:test to execute the unit tests affected by a change.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e my-app to execute the end-to-end tests via Cypress.\nRun nx affected:e2e to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.\nUnderstand your workspace\nRun nx graph to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.\nFurther help\nVisit the Nx Documentation to learn more.\n☁ Nx Cloud\nDistributed Computation Caching & Distributed Task Execution\n\n\nNx Cloud pairs with Nx in order to enable you to build and test code more rapidly, by up to 10 times. Even teams that are new to Nx can connect to Nx Cloud and start saving time instantly.\nTeams using Nx gain the advantage of building full-stack applications with their preferred framework alongside Nx’s advanced code generation and project dependency graph, plus a unified experience for both frontend and backend developers.\nVisit Nx Cloud to learn
